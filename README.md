# Spleef
A very basic Spleef minigame using my [minigame framework](https://github.com/bramhaag/minigame-framework).

This plugin is a simple example, and while this minigame is functional, you probably should not use it as there are many better Spleef plugins available.

The project contains three modules: `core`, `spigot` and `nukkit`. The `core` module contains nearly all minigame-related code.
The other two modules implement the commands and other platform-specific features for their respective platforms.
